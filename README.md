# 🛒 Playwright E-commerce Automation Framework

## 📌 Overview
<<<<<<< HEAD
A scalable test automation framework built using Python, Playwright, and Pytest following Page Object Model (POM) design with CI/CD integration.
=======

This project is a **scalable UI automation framework** built using Python, Playwright, and Pytest.

It follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern and supports **end-to-end testing of an e-commerce workflow**, including login, cart operations, and checkout.

## 📊 Reports

* HTML report generated after execution
* Screenshots captured automatically on failure

> Tip: Add a screenshot of the HTML report here to improve project presentation.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to:

* Install dependencies and Playwright browsers
* Execute tests in parallel
* Generate HTML reports
* Upload artifacts (reports and screenshots)

> Tip: Add a GitHub Actions badge here once your pipeline is stable.

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

* **POM (Page Object Model)**: Improves maintainability and reusability by separating UI logic from test logic
* **Fixtures**: Centralized setup and teardown for better test management
* **Parallel Execution**: Reduces test execution time using `pytest-xdist`
* **Environment-based configuration**: Enables flexibility across different environments (QA, staging, etc.)

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Tests failed in CI due to missing display server
**Solution:** Configured Playwright to run in headless mode and added CI-specific settings

**Challenge:** Flaky tests due to timing issues
**Solution:** Leveraged Playwright’s auto-waiting and implemented stable interaction methods

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Integrate Allure reporting
* Add API + UI hybrid testing
* Dockerize test execution
* Implement test data management strategy

---

## 🔥 Tech Stack

* Python
* Playwright
* Pytest
* GitHub Actions
